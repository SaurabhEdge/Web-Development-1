      <dl><dt></dt>
        <dd><br>- The Indian economy was in its worst phase even before the coronavirus
            outbreak, with growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) falling 
            to a <code class="cite">11-year low of 4.2 per cent in 2019-2020</code>.</dd>
        <dd><br>-  The economy grew by 3.1 per cent in the <code class="cite">January-March quarter of 2019-2020, 
            against 5.7
            per cent</code> at the same time a year ago, the slowest growth in at least eight years.</dd>
        <dd><br>- According to National Statistical Office data, the manufacturing sector has 
            <code class="cite">grown merely by 0.03 per cent in FY 2019-20 compared to 5.7 per cent</code> in the 
            previous year.</dd>
        <dd><br>-  The growth of the construction sector, which is responsible 
            for a spillover effect on several other industries, too <code class="cite">declined to 1.3 per cent.</code>

        <dd><br> - The quarterly GDP growth has consistently fallen since Q4 of FY18. If there is a 
            deviation in Q4 of FY19, as shown in the graph below, it is because the National 
            Statistical Office (NSO) revised its data on February 28, 2020, drastically 
            cutting down growth rates in the <code class="cite">first three-quarters of FY19 
            (from 8% to 7.1% for Quater1; from 7% to 6.2% in Quarter 2 and 6.6% to 5.6% 
            in Quarter 3.</code></dd>
        <dd><br>- The food and agriculture sector contributes the highest in GDP i.e. 
            <code class="cite">16.5% and 43% to the employment sector</code>. The major portion of the food 
            processing sector deals with <code class="cite">dairy (29%), edible oil (32%), and cereals (10%)</code>. 
            India also stands number one in dairy and spices products at a global scenario (export).</dd>
