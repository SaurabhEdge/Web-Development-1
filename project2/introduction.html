      <h3><b> Economy </b></h3>

      <dl>
       <dt></dt>
        <dd><br>-  As per definition, Economy is combination of production and consumption.
            The production and consumption of goods and services are used to fulfill 
            the needs of those living and operating within the economy, which is also 
            referred to as an economic system.</dd>
            <dd><br>To understand economy term, we must know that there are 2 pillars of it. </dd>
        <dd> <br>A)	<b>Production:</b> How much we produce as per user demand </dd>
        <dd>B)	<b>Consumption:</b> How much we consume </dd>

        <dd><br>When any economy is stable, below points will surely happen:</dd>
        <dd> <br>•	Lower risk of inflation which increases confidence levels in the currency</dd>
        <dd>•	The inflow of foreign direct investment which in turn triggers the growth of the economy </dd>
        <dd>•	A consistent output of the goods thus leading to increased exports leading to better
             trade relations with other countries.</dd>
        <dd><br><b>There are four types of economy exist:</b></dd>

      <h3><b> India </b></h3>
      <dl><dt></dt>
        <dd><br>- India, Hindustan, Bharat, Republic of India are the name of same country and
             it is the largest democracy in world. With roughly one-sixth of the world’s 
             total population, India is the second most populous country. </dd>
        <dd><br>- Its capital is New Delhi. Its government is a constitutional republic that 
            represents a highly diverse population consisting of millions of ethnic groups 
            and likely thousands of languages. </dd>
            <dd> <br>
              <figure class="right_next">
                <img src="assets/media/indian-flag.png" alt="flag" 
                width="300" height="200" class="responsive_img_1">
                <figcaption class="glen-cap">Fig 1: Indian Flag </figcaption>
                </figure>
             </dd>
        <dd><br>- As per historical facts, India was intermittently invaded by incursions 
            from beyond its northern mountain wall. Especially important was the coming 
            of Islam, brought from the northwest by Arab, Turkish, Persian, and other 
            raiders beginning early in the 8th century CE. </dd>
           
        <dd><br>- Eventually, some of those raiders stayed; by the 13th century much of the 
            subcontinent was under Muslim rule, and the number of Muslims steadily increased.
             Only after the arrival of the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama in 1498 and 
             the subsequent establishment of European maritime supremacy in the region did 
             India become exposed to major external influences arriving by sea, a process
              that culminated in the decline of the ruling Muslim elite and absorption of 
              the subcontinent within the British Empire. </dd>
        <dd><br>- Direct administration by the British, which began in 1858, effected a political 
            and economic unification of the subcontinent. When British rule came to an end in
             1947, the subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines into two separate 
             countries—India, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with a majority of 
             Muslims; the eastern portion of Pakistan later split off to form Bangladesh.</dd>
        <dd><br>- Many British institutions stayed in place (such as the parliamentary system of government);
             English continued to be a widely used lingua franca; and India remained within the 
             Commonwealth. Hindi became the official language (and several other local languages
              achieved official status), while a vibrant English-language intelligentsia thrived. </dd>
