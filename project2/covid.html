          <dd>- COVID‐19 is a systemic infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic 
            system and hemostasis.</dd>
          <dd><br>- Severe acute respiratory <code class="cite">syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2)</code> 
            causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has rapidly evolved from an epidemic 
            outbreak in Wuhan, China1 into a pandemic infecting more than 1 million individuals 
            all over the world.</dd>
          <dd><br>- Billions of citizens are affected by measures of social 
            distancing and the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic.</dd>
          <dd><br>- Note, <code class="cite">SARS‐CoV‐2</code> is
            approximately 80% similar to SARS‐CoV and invades host human cells by binding 
            to the angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.</dd>
          <dd><br>- There are some key differences between flu and COVID-19.
            COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more 
            serious illnesses in some people.</dd>
          <dd><br>- It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can 
            be contagious for longer.</dd>
            <dd>
            <figure >
              <img src="assets/media/covid_symptoms.jpg" alt="covid" width="800" height="500"
              class="responsive_img_3">
              <figcaption class="glen-cap">Fig 6 : Covid-19 symptoms</figcaption>
              </figure></dd>
          <dd><br>- Another important difference is there is a vaccine to protect 
            against flu. There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19.</dd>
          <dd><br>- Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar,
             it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms 
             alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis.</dd>
          <dd><br>-  Although it is well documented that COVID‐19 is primarily manifested as a respiratory 
            tract infection, emerging data indicate that it should be regarded as a systemic 
            disease involving <code class="cite">multiple systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory,
             gastrointestinal, neurological, hematopoietic and immune system.2-4 Mortality 
             rates</code> of COVID‐19 are lower than SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)</dd>
          <dd><br>-  however, COVID‐19 is more lethal than seasonal flu. Older people and those with 
            comorbidities are at increased risk of death from COVID‐19, but younger people 
            without major underlying diseases may also present with potentially lethal 
            complications such as fulminant myocarditis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC)</dd>
