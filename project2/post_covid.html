      <h3><b> Post Covid economy challenges: </b></h3>
      
      <p>
      -   As explained above that in covid lockdown whole country went under 
        lockdown and since this halted all economic activities. So, after 
        covid Indian economy have many things to consider or we can safely 
        say that government needs to reconsider the structure of Indian economy. 
        As predicted by various rating agencies, the GDP <code class="cite">growth of Indian 
        economy is not very pleasing</code>. 
      </p>

      <p>
      -  An already-slowing Indian economy has been derailed from its growth track after a stringent 
        shutdown was imposed in March to halt the spread of Covid-19. The jury is still out on 
        whether the lockdown dented the progress of the virus, but it has certainly damaged the
         economy.  India’s GDP is set to <code class="cite">contract anywhere between 5% and 10%</code>
            this year – for 
         the first time in four decades.</p>

      <p>
      -  Obviously, some of the damage will be long-lasting. Assuming that 
      <code class="cite">India’s economy grows at 7% between 
 2022 and 2024</code>, the permanent <code class="cite">loss would be 10%</code>, according to a recent 
 report from Mumbai-based 
 credit ratings agency CRISIL.</p>
 
      <p>
      -  “To catch-up would require average GDP <code class="cite">growth to surge to 11%</code>
  over the next three fiscals, something that has never happened before.”

While that enormous challenge looms, some experts and economists believe a recovery could
 be on the cards in the next six to nine months. It just won’t be straightforward.

      <h3>Sectoral Overview</h3>

      <dl>
        <dt> <b>Service</b>:</dt>

         -  The process of unlocking the economy has begun. The impact of the same across 
          industries in the service sector has been studied by Economic Times. 
          It suggests that industries such as <code class="cite">Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)</code> 
          would be performing good, digital demand would be performing above average. 
          </dd>
          <dd>
            <br>-  <code class="cite">E-commerce, retail, power, smartphones, and petroleum</code> would be performing 
         average compared to their last year’s performance and growth in the next
          year 2021. However, industries such as ride-hailing or taxi, hospitality,
           automobiles, aviation, real estate would find it difficult to retain their 
           business. </dd>
           <dd>
            <br>-   Moreover, it should not be forgotten that it’s still early days 
           to start quantifying the <code class="cite">demand growth or demand slump without waiting 
           for one or two months</code> to see how it goes.     
         In the service sector, most of the IT companies have been following work from 
         home (WFH) during the lockdown and are likely to continue to follow it in the 
         future as well. Many of them see this option as a vital option as it has saved 
         major operation and maintenance cost of these companies.

          <br><b>Industry:</b> <br></dt>
        <dd><br>
        -  There are major challenges faced by the manufacturing units of companies 
          even after the process of unlocking has been initiated. It includes hurdles 
          such as mounting costs and comparatively low or no revenue due to shortage 
          of labour leading to a reduction in the <code class="cite">level of production, markets are not
           fully open therefore limited sale, the employers</code> have been advised to make 
           arrangements for labourers or workers to stay at the premise of the factory.
            This is the case of an established company.</dd>
         <dd>
         <br>
        -  Not to be missed an integral part of the <code class="cite">manufacturing sector, the Micro, Small, 
         and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)</code> who are likely to face more challenges in operation.
          The loans guarantee against the Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and investment 
          facilities provided to MSMEs are more or less bank-centric and pay little 
          attention to providing the money immediately to the MSMEs to re-start their 
          business, pay salaries and also for other operating costs.</dd>
         
          <dd>
            <br>
        -  Further, these loans are not reaching the MSMEs mainly due to two reasons. 
         Firstly, the banks were undertaking only essential services during the lockdown 
         period as per directives. This included <code class="cite">cash deposits, withdrawals, salary and 
         pension payments, clearing of cheques, remittances, besides all interbank and 
         government transactions and giving loans </code>were not part of essential services;
          secondly, non-availability of stamp papers for the bank guarantees. </dd>
          
          <dd>
            <br>
        -  These issues are the stumbling blocks on the suddenly over-relied manufacturing policy i.e. 
        <code class="cite">‘Make in India’</code>. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to focus on the implementation 
          of the government policies and ensure that the aid reaches the needy so that the 
          wheel of the economy begins to move.</dd>

          <dt><br>
            <br> <b>Agriculture</b>: <br></dt>
          <dd> <br>
          -  COVID-19 has provided us to revamp the agriculture sector that has been the 
            ailing sector over the years due to various reasons which are <code class="cite">lack of private 
            investment, water scarcity, inefficiency in the implementation of various 
            policies on the ground, marketing and pricing challenges</code>. All of these issues
             result in the increasing vulnerability of the poor farmers. Out of all these
              issues, the Government of India has addressed one during the announcement 
              of ‘Atmanirbhar’ a series of policy reforms to tackle the economy post-COVID-19.</dd>
            <dd><br>
          -  Now, as per the announcement, a new central law will be formulated to provide 
            barrier-free inter-state trade of farm produce and more freedom for farmers 
            to sell directly or even online. Through this, the restriction over the farmers
             to sell their product or products in nearby <code class="cite">agricultural produce market 
             committees (APMCs)</code> is removed and they are allowed to sell their products 
             any part of the country. In a way, this move will help farmers to reduce 
             their vulnerability and increase their revenue. </dd>
            <dd><br>
          -  Nevertheless, farmers will 
             have to incur the transportation cost which might not be possible for all 
             the farmers especially, the small and marginal farmers. In such scenarios, 
             they can opt for co-operative transportation or two or three or more farmers 
             pooling the transportation facilities together as a way to reach new markets 
             in other cities and towns to reduce the cost borne by each one of them. </dd>
            
            <dd><br>
          -  Further, in order to export agricultural products, farmers will have to improve 
            the quality of the products. As in 2014, the European Union (EU) banned the 
            import of mangoes, eggplant, the taro plant, bitter gourd and snake gourd, 
            citing <code class="cite">“significant shortcomings in the phytosanitary certification system 
            of such products exported to the EU”</code> from India. Therefore, to leverage trading 
            opportunities, this is the time for farmers to take into consideration and 
            focus on organic farming to reach the quality of products as per global health 
            standards.</dd>
