      <h3><b> Economy in Covid: </b></h3>

      <dl><dt></dt>
       
        <dd>- The abrupt nationwide lockdown imposed across India on March 24 was the 
          biggest in the world, forcing 1.3 billion Indians to stay indoors. 
          The lockdown restrictions were imposed without any preparation or 
          coordination with states.</dd>
     
        <dd><br>- Except for some essential services and activities, 
          the rest of <code class="cite">India’s $2.9 trillion economy</code> remained shuttered during the 
          lockdown period. </dd>
        <dd><br>- The lockdown had devastating impacts on an already 
          slowing economy and people’s livelihoods as <code class="cite">shops, eateries, factories, 
          transport, services, and business</code> establishments were shuttered. </dd>
        <dd><br>- Consequently, the Indian <code class="cite">economy contracted by 23.9% in the April-June 
          quarter</code> of this fiscal year.</dd>
          <dd><br>

              </figure>
          </dd>
          

        <dd><br>- India’s GDP contraction was worse than any of the <code class="cite">world’s biggest economies
          including the US (9.1%) and Italy (17.7%)</code> ― two countries severely hit by 
          the coronavirus pandemic. For the Indian economy, private consumption and
           investment are the two biggest engines for growth.</dd>
        <dd><br>-  During the first 
          quarter of 2020, <code class="cite">private consumption ― accounting for 59% of India’s
           GDP ― declined by 27%</code>, while investments by private businesses fell
            by 47%. India’s net exports turned positive due to sharp compression 
            in imports.</dd>
        <dd><br>- During the quarter, government <code class="cite">spending increased by 16%</code>,
          but it was not adequate to compensate for the decline suffered by 
          other engines of growth. Except for agriculture, all the major sectors
           of the economy were badly hit.</dd>
      
      <dd><br>- While India has gradually improved in the World Bank's ease of doing 
        business ranking, there is clearly still room for streamlining investment.</dd>
   
    <dd><br>-  In particular, the appearance that foreign firms do not face a level playing 
      field with domestic competitors will need to be dealt with if firms leaving 
      China are to make India a preferred destination. For many Indians though, 
      more important still would be agriculture reform, and the steps taken in 
      the stimulus package do hint at wider agricultural reform.</dd>
